# Main code contributions

## State machine configuration used by Trace SAS
Example of the [simple state machine configuration specifications](https://github.com/bc24-miage-dev/BC24-Smart-Traceability/blob/master/resource_templates/templates.ts)

## Trace SAS Smart Contract
The [Trace SAS Smart contract](https://github.com/bc24-miage-dev/BC24-Smart-Traceability/blob/master/contracts/BC24.sol) follows the BC24 smart contract model. It has been extensively tested, get more details on the [repository](https://github.com/bc24-miage-dev/BC24-Smart-Traceability)

## Format StateMachineSpec verification tool

We provide a [software component](https://github.com/bc24-miage-dev/BC24-Smart-Traceability/tree/master/template_validator
) to verify that the [StateMachineSpecs](https://github.com/bc24-miage-dev/BC24-Smart-Traceability/blob/master/resource_templates/templates.ts) is valid.
